## The deployed application
[CHECK OUT THE TECH BLOG SIGHT ON HEROKU ](https://mysterious-brook-54092.herokuapp.com/)
## Task on this Assignment

My challenge this week is to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. I am required to build this site completely from scratch and deploy it to Heroku. This app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## TOOLS and SOFTWARE

* Node.js
* EXPRESS.js, express-session, connect-session-sequelize, express-handlebars
* ORM - Object Relational Mapping
* MVC - Model View Controller
* Bulma,  CSS
* Javascript
* Heroku, JAWSMySQLDB

## FUNCTIONALITY

1. You can view the page but you cannot post or comment on it unless you signup or login.

3. After you sign up you can click the dashboard and create your post, edit or delete your old post if any and it will be added on the table of post collections.

4. You can also view each post and comment on it and it will be added on the comment section with your name, date and option to delete your comment.
